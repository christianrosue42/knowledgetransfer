## Sorting
### Bubble Sort

- "Orcish Sorting"
- only for tiny datasets
- slow: O(n²) on large datasets

### QuickSort

- "Elven Sort"
- Divide & Conquer
- Organizing in two groups "weaker" (left) and stronger (right) based on pivot (strength in this case)
 * High performant (O(n log n) on average
 * Worst Case O(n²) with poor pivot selection
